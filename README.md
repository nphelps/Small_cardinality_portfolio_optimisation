# Small cardinality portfolio optimisation
This is R code for generating efficient portfolios with small cardinality constraints. There are four variations of an algorithm created by Graham and Craven (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01605682.2020.1718019). These four variations will be described in a paper and a link to the paper will be provided here when it is published. The files provided were designed to be run on SHARCNET, but they can be run locally.

The code for their original algorithm is available here: https://github.com/MJCraven/SiftedQP.
