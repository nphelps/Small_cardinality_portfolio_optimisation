# Small_cardinality_portfolio_optimisation
This is R code for generating efficient portfolios with small cardinality constraints. There are four variations of an algorithm created by Graham and Craven (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01605682.2020.1718019). The code for their original algorithm is available here: https://github.com/MJCraven/SiftedQP.
